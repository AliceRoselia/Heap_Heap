# This is a failing project, this is kept for historical purpose.

# Heap_Heap
A practical priority queue built with modern hardwar in consideration.

This repository is building in progress.

#What went wrong:

I tried to recursively construct heap. This was inspired
by Van Emde Boas tree. However, I tried to use vector and preallocate to control
fragmentation, and it failed. 

This may have to be abandoned.
